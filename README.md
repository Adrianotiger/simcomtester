# SimCom Tester
This webpage will let you send some simple commands to your SimCom Module.

# Setup
- Connect your module with your PC (USB or Serial).
- Open the webpage with Edge, Chrome or another browser with Serial-functionality.
- Press on "Connect" and select the right serial port on your browser (the first SimTech serial port, on USB)
- If everything is connected, you should see something like this:

# How to use
- You can press any predefined commands on the left panel
- Or you can write the commands directly in the "chat"
- If you press on "ðŸ“ƒ" a tutorial should be visible for that command.

# Issues  
This webpage is just a preview or draft. Please do not submit any issues about missing commands, as I am still working (and probably I will rewrite some parts).  
I am testing a SIM7080 Module, so this page has some 7080-specific commands.

The structure should let me/us to add (without much works) more commands and to add module-specific commands.

The page is not able to parse "unsolicited results". I need to integrate this functionality.
